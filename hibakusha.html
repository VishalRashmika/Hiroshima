      <h3 class='sbtopic'>The <span class='spaned'>survivors</span> of the <span class='spaned'>bombings</span></h3>
      
      <p>The survivors of the bombings are called <span class='spaned'>hibakusha</span> (被爆者), a Japanese word that literally translates to <span class='spaned'>"explosion-affected people"</span>. The Japanese government has recognized about <span class='spaned'>650,000</span> people as hibakusha. As of 31 March 2021, <span class='spaned'>127,755</span> were still <span class='spaned'>alive</span>, mostly in Japan. The <span class='spaned'>government of Japan</span> recognizes about <span class='spaned'>one</span> percent of these as having illnesses caused by <span class='spaned'>radiation</span>. The <span class='spaned'>memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki</span> contain lists of the names of the hibakusha who are known to have died since the <span class='spaned'>bombings</span>. Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, as of <span class='spaned'>August 2021</span>, the memorials record the names of almost <span class='spaned'>520,000</span> hibakusha; <span class='spaned'>328,929</span> in Hiroshima and <span class='spaned'>189,163</span> in Nagasaki.</p>


      <p>if they discuss their <span class='spaned'>background</span>, Hibakusha and their <span class='spaned'>children</span> were (and still are) victims of fear based <span class='spaned'> discrimination </span> and <span class='spaned'> exclusion </span> when it comes to prospects of <span class='spaned'> marriage </span> or work due to public <span class='spaned'> ignorance </span> about the <span class='spaned'> consequences </span> of radiation sickness or that the low doses that the <span class='spaned'> majority </span> received were less than a routine diagnostic <span class='spaned'> x-ray </span>, much of the public however <span class='spaned'> persist </span> with the belief that the Hibakusha carry some <span class='spaned'> hereditary </span> or even contagious disease. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable <span class='spaned'> increase </span> of birth defects/congenital <span class='spaned'> malformations </span> was found among the later conceived children  <span class='spaned'> born to survivors </span> of the <span class='spaned'> nuclear weapons </span> used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or indeed has been found in the later <span class='spaned'> conceived </span> children of <span class='spaned'> cancer </span> survivors who had previously received <span class='spaned'> radiotherapy </span>. The surviving <span class='spaned'> women </span> of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could conceive, who were <span class='spaned'> exposed </span> to substantial amounts of <span class='spaned'> radiation </span> , went on and had children with no higher incidence of <span class='spaned'> abnormalities/birth </span> defects than the <span class='spaned'> rate </span> which is observed in the Japanese average. A study of the long-term <span class='spaned'> psychological effects </span> of the bombings on the survivors found that even <span class='spaned'> 17–20 years </span> after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of <span class='spaned'> anxiety </span> and <span class='spaned'> somatization </span> symptoms.</p>
