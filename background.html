      <h3 class='sbtopic'>Pacific <span class='spaned'>War</span></h3>
      <p>In 1945, the Pacific War between the <span class='spaned'>Empire of Japan</span> and the Allies entered its fourth year. Most Japanese military units fought <span class='spaned'>fiercely</span>, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The <span class='spaned'>1.25 million battle casualties</span> incurred in total by the United States in <span class='spaned'>World War II</span> included both military personnel <span class='spaned'>killed</span> in action and wounded in action. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from <span class='spaned'>June 1944 to June 1945</span>. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of <span class='spaned'>88,000</span> as a result of the German Ardennes Offensive. America's reserves of <span class='spaned'>manpower</span> were running <span class='spaned'>out</span>. Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women. At the same time, the public was becoming <span class='spaned'>war-weary</span>, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent <span class='spaned'>home</span>.</p>


      <p>In the Pacific, the Allies returned to the <span class='spaned'>Philippines</span>, recaptured <span class='spaned'>Burma</span>, and invaded <span class='spaned'>Borneo</span>. Offensives were undertaken to reduce the <span class='spaned'>Japanese forces</span> remaining in <span class='spaned'>Bougainville</span>, New Guinea and the Philippines. In <span class='spaned'>April 1945</span>, American forces landed on <span class='spaned'>Okinawa</span>, where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from five to one in the Philippines to two to one on Okinawa. Although some Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner, most fought until they were killed or committed suicide. Nearly <span class='spaned'>99 percent of the 21,000</span> defenders of Iwo Jima were <span class='spaned'>killed</span>. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending Okinawa in April to June 1945, <span class='spaned'>94 percent were killed</span>; 7,401 Japanese soldiers <span class='spaned'>surrendered</span>, an unprecedentedly <span class='spaned'>large</span> number.</p>
